<center><h1>Pollution Control Services</h1>
Pollution Control Services is an environmental laboratory doing business in South Texas since 1975.
<br< We specialize in chemical testing, biological testing, and routine bacteriological testing of
<br>portable water systems.<br>

<h2>Our Capabilities</h2><br>

Our experienced team can prepare a final laboratory report with relevant QA/QC information on all 
<br<samples submitted for analytical evaluation as standard procedure. Additionally, summary reports 
<br>on batches of client samples are available. Summary reports that integrate graphics or require 
<br>incorporation of additional information are available for a low fee.<br>

Promoting the Safety and Longevity of Your Reports

We maintain all relevant data generation information on the services and reports we provide to clients
<br> for a maximum of seven years (after which the information will be destroyed and disposed of to 
<br>protect your personal records from being exposed). All analytical reports of sample analysis will be 
<br>archived on computer tape and stored for as long as reasonably possible beyond the 7-year time frame<br>.</center>

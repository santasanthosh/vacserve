<h1>introduction</h1>
<p></p><h3>pollution is the process of making land, water, air or other parts of the environment dirty and not safe// or suitable to use. This can be done through the introduction of a
 contaminant into a natural environment, but the contaminant doesn't need to be tangible. Things as simple as light, sound and temperature can be considered pollutants when 
 introduced artificially into an environment. 

Toxic pollution affects more than 200 million people worldwide, according to Pure Earth, a non-profit environmental organization. In some of the world's worst polluted places, 
babies are born with birth defects, children have lost 30 to 40 IQ points, and life expectancy may be as low as 45 years because of cancers and other diseases.</h3><p></p>

 <h2><u>water pollution</u></h2>
 <p>British poet W. H. Auden once noted, “Thousands have lived without love, not one without water.” Yet while we all know water is crucial for life, we trash it 
 anyway. Some 80 percent of the world’s wastewater is dumped—largely untreated—back into the environment, polluting rivers, lakes, and oceans.<br>

This widespread problem of water pollution is jeopardizing our health. Unsafe water kills more people each year than war and all other forms of violence combined.
<br> Meanwhile, our drinkable water sources are finite: Less than 1 percent of the earth’s freshwater is actually accessible to us. Without action, the challenges 
<br>will only increase by 2050, when global demand for freshwater is expected to be one-third greater than it is now.

Sip a glass of cool, clear water as you read this, and you may think water pollution is a problem . . . somewhere else. But while most Americans have access to safe drinking water
<br>, potentially harmful contaminants—from arsenic to copper to lead—have been found in the tap water of every single state in the nation.

Still, we’re not hopeless against the threat to clean water. To better understand the problem and what we can do about it, here’s an overview of 
<br>what water pollution is, what causes it, and how we can protect ourselves.
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p><h1>What Is Water Pollution?</h1>
Water pollution occurs when harmful substances—often chemicals or microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body of water, degrading water quality 
<br>and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment.<br>

<h1>What Are the Causes of Water Pollution?</h1>
Water is uniquely vulnerable to pollution. Known as a “universal solvent,” water is able to dissolve more substances than any other liquid on earth. It’s the reason we have
<br> Kool-Aid and brilliant blue waterfalls. It’s also why water is so easily polluted. Toxic substances from farms, towns, and factories readily dissolve into and mix with it,
<br> causing water pollution.<br>

<h1>Categories of Water Pollution</h1>
<u>Groundwater</u>
When rain falls and seeps deep into the earth, filling the cracks, crevices, and porous spaces of an aquifer (basically an underground storehouse of water), it becomes 
<br>groundwater—one of our least visible but most important natural resources. Nearly 40 percent of Americans rely on groundwater, pumped to the earth’s surface, for drinking water.
<br> For some folks in rural areas, it’s their only freshwater source. Groundwater gets polluted when contaminants—from pesticides and fertilizers to waste leached from landfills
<br> and septic systems—make their way into an aquifer, rendering it unsafe for human use. Ridding groundwater of contaminants can be difficult to impossible, as well as costly. 
<br>Once polluted, an aquifer may be unusable for decades, or even thousands of years. Groundwater can also spread contamination far from the original polluting source as it seeps 

<br>into streams, lakes, and oceans.
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Surface water</u></b>
Covering about 70 percent of the earth, surface water is what fills our oceans, lakes, rivers, and all those other blue bits on the world map. Surface water from freshwater sources 
<br>(that is, from sources other than the ocean) accounts for more than 60 percent of the water delivered to American homes. But a significant pool of that water is in peril.
<br> According to the most recent surveys on national water quality from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, nearly half of our rivers and streams and more than one-third 
<br>of our lakes are polluted and unfit for swimming, fishing, and drinking. Nutrient pollution, which includes nitrates and phosphates, is the leading type of contamination in
<br> these freshwater sources. While plants and animals need these nutrients to grow, they have become a major pollutant due to farm waste and fertilizer runoff. Municipal and <br>
industrial waste discharges contribute their fair share of toxins as well. There’s also all the random junk that industry and individuals dump directly into waterways.<br>

**TAKE ACTION<br>
***Ocean water<br>
Eighty percent of ocean pollution (also called marine pollution) originates on land—whether along the coast or far inland. Contaminants such as chemicals, nutrients, 
<br>and heavy metals are carried from farms, factories, and cities by streams and rivers into our bays and estuaries; from there they travel out to sea. Meanwhile,
<br> marine debris—particularly plastic—is blown in by the wind or washed in via storm drains and sewers. Our seas are also sometimes spoiled by oil spills and leaks—big 
<br>and small—and are consistently soaking up carbon pollution from the air. The ocean absorbs as much as a quarter of man-made carbon emissions.<br>

<b>land pollution</b>
<h1>What Is Land Pollution</h1>
The basic definition of land pollution is the destruction and contamination of the land through the direct and indirect actions of humans. The pollution results in changes
<br> to the land, such as soil erosion. Some of the changes are irreversible, while others are not.<br>
<br>

The effects of land pollution do not necessarily appear overnight. It is the result of long-term destruction from human activities. For instance, the damage from chemicals
<br> from an oil spill can take months or even years to be fully realized.
<br>
<h3>Causes of Land Pollution</h3><br>
There are several known causes of land pollution. Of those, there are six factors that contribute more than others.<br>


<h3>1. Deforestation and soil erosion</h3><br>
When forests are cleared for development and to meet the demand for wood supply, the soil is loosened in the process. Without the protection of the trees, the land becomes 
<br>barren over time and starts to erode.<br>
<center><img src="./polluton1_files/8.jpg" style="
    width: 400px;
"></center>
<h3>2. Agricultural chemicals</h3>
<br>
Part of the farming process often involves the use of harmful pesticides and insecticides to protect crops. However, the chemicals can cause the land to become barren.
<br> The once-fertile soil is then more susceptible to environmental elements, such as the wind.<br>

<br>


<h1>Effects of Land Pollution</h1>
<br>
<h4>The contamination of the land has far-reaching consequences that can be catastrophic for water, soil, and animals. There are several possible consequences of land pollution 
<br>to the environment and animals, including these top two:</h4><br>

<h3>1. Ground water poisoning</h3><br>
Depending on the soil and whether the chemicals were improperly disposed of on the land, the chemicals could end up in the ground water. The process is known as leaching. 
<br>It can occur on farms, industrial sites, and landfills.<br>

<h3>2. Water nutrient enrichment</h3><br< chemicals,="" such="" as="" nitrogen,="" are="" used="" frequently="" on="" farms.="" only="" a="" small="" portion="" of="" the="" nutrients="" end="" up="" benefitting="" crops.="" remainder="" usually="" ends="" in="" water="" that="" <br="">is populated by fish, algae, and other lifeforms. The nutrient-heavy water saps up most of the oxygen in the water, which leaves little for fish and other life. When this 
<br>happens, the water is unable to support most lifeforms. For more information on water polution, click here. <br>

<h1>Effects of Land Pollution on Humans</h1>
The impact of land pollution is not limited just to the earth and animals. Humans can also experience negative consequences that can influence quality of life and health.<br>

Some of the potential consequences include birth defects, the development of breathing disorders, skin diseases, and cancer. Most of these develop after exposure to waste
<br> from water poisoning and soil contamination.<br>

Land pollution has also been linked to developmental deficits in children. Chemicals that are commonly found in contaminated soil and water, such as lead, have can impact 
<br>a child’s cognitive development even if the exposure is very low.<br>

<h2>Solutions to Land Pollution</h2>
There are several possible solutions to land pollution, including conservation. Conservation focuses on preserving natural resources, such as soil and plants.
<br> The efforts to conserve resources can start with utilizing sustainable practices.<br>

For instance, leaving some of the trees in a forest to naturally die and decay. This not only leaves the cover needed for the soil and other vegetation, but it helps to 
<br>provide the nutrients that the soil needs to remain fertile. Other solutions include:<br>

Proper waste disposal that focuses on treating waste and disposing it in the safest manner possible.<br>
Reusing materials to reduce the need for harvesting of resources. Products that are not reusable can likely be recycled.<br>
Reducing the usage of non-biodegradable materials, such as plastic shopping bags. The simple act of switching to a reusable cloth bag for groceries can help 
<br>cut down on the need for non-biodegradable materials.<br>
Organic gardening can reduce the usage of pesticides and insecticides. Non-gardeners can help by buying organic food.<br>

<h2>sound pollution</h2>
<p>Noise pollution, unwanted or excessive sound that can have deleterious effects on human health and environmental quality. Noise pollution is commonly generated inside
<br> many industrial facilities and some other workplaces, but it also comes from highway, railway, and airplane traffic and from outdoor construction activities.<br>
<center><img src="pooja7.jpg" style="width:420px"></center>


<p></p>
<h2>air pollution</h2>
<br>
Air pollution is a mix of particles and gases that can reach harmful concentrations both outside and indoors. Its effects can range from higher disease risks to rising
<br<>temperatures. Soot, smoke, mold, pollen, methane, and carbon dioxide are a just few examples of common pollutants.<br>


In the U.S., one measure of outdoor air pollution is the Air Quality Index, or AQI which rates air conditions across the country based on concentrations of five major
<br> pollutants: ground-level ozone, particle pollution (or particulate matter), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Some of those also contribute to 
<br>indoor air pollution, along with radon, cigarette smoke, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), formaldehyde, asbestos, and other substances.<br>
